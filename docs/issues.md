## Windows 11 Taskbar cannot be customised

Direct customisation of the Windows 11 taskbar isn't possible without sysprepping the image. This means that the taskbar layout for Windows PCs or other static machines customised with this solution, won't have the taskbar customised. It should work on gold images for virtual desktops that are sysprepped after being customised.

See [Customize the Taskbar](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/customize-the-windows-11-taskbar) for details on the steps required to customise the Windows 11 taskbar.
