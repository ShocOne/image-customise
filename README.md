# Windows Customised Defaults

Customise a Windows 10/11, Windows Server 2016/2019/2022 image with default user profile settings, in-box application removal / updates, and OS configurations to improve the end-user experience.

Designed for use with deploying physical PCs and virtual desktop gold images, these customisations will also work other Windows images including Windows Server infrastructure roles.

Documentation on how to use and implement these scripts is found here: [https://stealthpuppy.com/image-customise/](https://stealthpuppy.com/image-customise/).
